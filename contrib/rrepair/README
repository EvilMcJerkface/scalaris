This folder contains several utility scripts to evaluate replica repair
(rrepair) algorithms. The Makefile defines several targets running experiments
with Scalaris. The results are then plotted with gnuplot.

Note that Scalaris itself needs to be configured (best with disabled debug mode
for faster executions) and made. The latter can be repeated with
> make scalaris

The EVAL_REPEATS variable sets the number of repetitions (100 by default).
Parallel builds are supported.

Example:

> make trivial_single-all.unaligned/0.001/trivial.dat EVAL_REPEATS=10


These targets run the most important pre-defined tests in parallel (2 jobs):
> make -j2 trivial shash bloom merkle

Manual tests can be run with the help of rr_eval.sh. Please refer to the
examples in the Makefile to create own targets and manual tests.
